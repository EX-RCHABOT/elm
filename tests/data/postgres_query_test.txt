  'Furthermore, projects in the queue have requested to come online  before 2026. Though realistically, not all of these projects will end up being developed, the  number of projects requesting to come online suggests a need to expedite the rate at which  hybrids will be deployed in the coming years. Finally, increased policy support on the federal  and state levels, such as through financial incentives within the Inflation Reduction Act and the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, have reduced deployment barriers for hybrid facilities.         33    This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.    Hybridization offers a variety of technical and economic benefits. As detailed in this report,  hybrid facilities have the potential to add value or alleviate concerns in the following areas (in no  specific order):    â€¢ Infrastructure and transmission. Sharing infrastructure and plant components can  result in project cost savings. Grid-connected HPPs can benefit developers and plant  owners by maximizing power production without expanded transmission, which avoids  costly upgrades, extended timelines, and additional permitting. Hybrid facilities operating  in an off-grid configuration can shorten timelines associated with interconnection queues  from 5-8 years to 3-5 years and avoid transmission interconnection costs.    â€¢ Economic and market participation.',
  'Conversion technologies have  been identified as a key driver in helping decarbonize hard-to-abate industries, such as steel  production and chemical processing, and are sometimes referred to as power-to-X applications.  While the addition of a battery to an HES is not necessary for reaping the end-use benefits that  hybridization is able to provide, storage can help with optimizing operations by ensuring  consistent and reliable electricity flow into the conversion process.          4    This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.    2 Current and Future Hybrid Considerations   In recent years, decreasing costs of renewable generation and battery technologies, and  increasing policy support have reduced barriers for deployment. The type of hybrid facility and  location depends heavily on technology maturation and market drivers that will continue to  factor into future deployment. The following section expands on the market drivers of hybrid  development and provides a current snapshot and outlook of hybrid deployment.    2.1 Driving Market Factors  Two market drivers of HPPs are the decreasing costs and increasing policy support of renewable  energy generation and battery technologies.',
  'Additionally, the deployment of HPPs is likely to be further accelerated by the  decline in the LCOE of PV plus storage, which is expected to decrease from $93.1/MWh in 2023  to $51.4/MWh in 2050 (-44.7%) (NREL 2023).     Although HPPs are projected to increase in generation capacity, realizing the benefits and  mitigating the challenges of HPP development is still essential for successful deployment.         15    This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.    Currently, PV-plus-storage is the most common HPP configuration. Despite PV-plus-storage  making up the majority of queue, it is expected that every project will not come to fruition.  Furthermore, the estimated cost declines in all renewable technology adds to the uncertainty of  which configuration will become the most common. Through optimizing the configuration of  HPPs for specific locations and end uses, developers and consumers of HPP electricity and  byproducts can maximize the benefits associated with these respective technologies.               16    This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.    3 Benefits, Challenges, and Complexities  As demonstrated by the increasing development pipeline, hybrids offer many benefits that are  not realized with single-technology VRE resources.',
  'As such,  existing market participation rules may not realize the full capabilities of hybrid facilities  to support grid functions, such as charging from the grid and ancillary services, therefore  impacting revenue potential.    â€¢ High-cost technology. Although renewable generation technology is cost competitive  with traditional technologies, conversion technologies are still relatively expensive  (Tashie-Lewis and Nnabuife 2021). The U.S. Energy Information Agency projects that  the costs of these technologies will decline over time; however, upfront costs are  currently a challenge for unlocking additional revenue streams (Energy Information  Administration [EIA] 2022).     â€¢ Design complexities. HPP and HES configurations can differ substantially depending on  the intended end use. Market conditions, region-specific characteristics, as well as the  facilities asset management strategyâ€”operated for financial or technical optimizationâ€” can influence the design of a facility. Due to these factors, the developer, plant owner, or  operator, need to evaluate many plant design considerations that can influence the  economics of a project.    â€¢ Operation and reliability. HPPs contain interfaces between different systems. As a  result, system integration and reliability can be a challenge associated with plant  customizability. There are also greater sensitivities to any type of connection disruption  within a hybrid facility when compared to an equivalent-capacity collection of standalone  single technology facilities that are all connected to the grid separately, where the loss of  one connection would not affect the connection of the others.',

  'As HPPs and modeling capabilities continue to mature, it is anticipated that market  participation rules will become more inclusive of HPPs.    3.6 Beneficiaries   Although market participation and deployment remain uncertain, the benefits of hybrids can be  realized by various stakeholder groups. From the procurement and development phase to  operation, stakeholders all are beneficiaries of varying degrees. These groups include developers;  subcontractors; plant owners and operators; grid and market operators; hard-to-abate sectors;  residential and commercial consumers; and governments. Some of the benefits include:    â€¢ Developers can build facilities with fewer geographic and plant characteristic restraints.   â€¢ Governments have a pathway to achieve renewable electricity and decarbonization    targets.   â€¢ Grid operators have fewer challenges in managing and balancing the grid.   â€¢ Consumers can benefit from low-cost electricity, hydrogen, and other vectors.         29    This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.    3.6.1 Developers and Subcontractors  Hybrid facilities can offer substantial benefits to developers when compared to traditional single- technology VRE facilities. Through the combined management of multiple technologies within  one facility, developers and subcontractors can realize associated benefits by sharing resources  and costs during planning and approval, site acquisition, and the construction and development  stages of a facility.',

  "In our perspective, one unique way of considering the  effectiveness of a policy and the technologies it favors was displayed by Fangwei Cheng. Cheng  plotted the lifecycle GHG emissions reductions from various technologies compared with the  levelized subsidy value that they receive from IRA, as shown in Figure 8. Since one of the main  intentions of the IRA was to reduce GHG emissions, technologies with higher emissions  reductions would be expected to receive higher subsidy levels. There is a correlation between  these two variables for SMR, biogas-hydrogen and other technologies. However, the subsidy for  electrolysis per kg of hydrogen produced is significantly more than its lifecycle emissions  reduction. This is because ~95% of hydrogen currently produced is ''grey hydrogen'', made with         18    natural gas from the grid via SMR or Autothermal Reforming without CCS (Cheng 2023). IRA  focused on driving a new hydrogen economy, beyond simply meeting existing hydrogen  demand.     Another topic of interest globally was the effect of the variability of wind and solar PV on  electricity markets. While this is a question that has been considered for years, many countries  are reaching VRE deployment levels that actively influence wholesale prices. This raises concern  about how markets will accurately compensate players for their participation. The discussion at  IEW ranged from VRE's effect on capacity markets (Holt 2023), ancillary service markets  (Hyungkwan Kim 2023) and wholesale markets (Ma 2023; Du 2023).",

  'Finally, if an existing brownfield site is converted  into a hybrid facility, there are further advantages. For example, if market rules allow, projects  can take advantage of existing interconnections, thus reducing project costs and associated lead  times of development.     3.6.2 Owners and Plant Operators  Hybridization provides various operational advantages to the owners and operators, including  increased opportunities to participate in energy markets, greater incentive eligibility, and fewer  curtailment risks. These benefits can increase project revenue for owners and operators.    Depending on market rules and design, expanded revenue stream opportunities may be available  through additional market participation (Ahlstrom 2019). For example, adding storage to a  renewable generation resource allows an HPP to participate in ancillary services, such as  frequency regulation. In addition, integrating energy storage into a hybrid plant, can minimize  curtailment. As a result, owners can maximize their profitability by mitigating economic losses  associated with curtailment.    3.6.3 Grid and Market Operators  When compared to a single-technology VRE, hybridization offers system operators improved  flexibility and reliability through increased grid service capabilities. Hybrid power plants can be  designed to meet specific grid and market conditions, including providing baseload power, peak  demand, or ancillary services more effectively, while still generating electricity. These  advantages can provide greater flexibility for system operators and can mitigate grid reliability  and resiliency issues.',
  'Battery technologies are  also becoming more cost-effective, decreasing from $1,306/kWh in 2010 to $151/kWh in 2022.  Furthermore, NRELâ€™s Annual Technology Baseline modeling indicates that the LCOE of solar  PV could decline by 52% from 2023 to 2050, and wind LCOE could decline by 37%. Similarly,  the LCOE of solar PV-plus-storage configurations are anticipated to fall by 45% (NREL 2023).  These declines are expected to increase the economic viability of hybrid facilities, not only  achieving cost parity with but also surpassing their traditional generation counterparts. Currently,  the most common hybrid plant configuration by far, in the development pipeline is PV plus  storage, followed by wind-based hybrid configurations, albeit trailing further behind. Solar PV  and wind-based hybrid facilities represent a growing share of future clean energy projects in the  development pipeline. In 2017, HPPs made up negligible portions of the interconnection queue,  but in 2021 HPP configurations accounted for 42% of solar projects and 8% of wind projects  (Bolinger et al. 2022). However, deployment trends will depend on region-specific  characteristics, such as local resource profiles, load demand profiles, and access to grid and  transmission infrastructure. Furthermore, projects in the queue have requested to come online  before 2026.',
  'Hybrid power plants have an  advantage over single-technology VRE generation when considering time matching because of  their ability to provide more consistent power (Esposito, Gimon, and Oâ€™Boyle 2023).    3.5.3 Market Participation Constraints   Due to the novelty of hybrids, how these facilities are allowed to operate within energy markets  remains uncertain. While there is increasing policy clarity, such as the various FERC orders  discussed in Section 2.1.2, constraints around market design currently prevent the full value of  hybrid capabilities from being realized. Some of these market participation constraints include  restrictions pertaining to charging battery storage from the grid, and a hybrid facilityâ€™s ability to  participate in all market structures. These constraints are variable and highly dependent on  specific market and state rules. In the PJM market, an HPP that includes storage is only allowed  to charge from co-located generation sources and is prevented from charging from the grid.  These types of constraints limit the ability of HPPs to provide grid management and load  smoothing services (FERC 2021). These limitations are often tied to the nature of grid  interconnection approval processes, or limitations with how RTOs and ISOs model hybrid power  plants. As HPPs and modeling capabilities continue to mature, it is anticipated that market  participation rules will become more inclusive of HPPs.    3.6 Beneficiaries   Although market participation and deployment remain uncertain, the benefits of hybrids can be  realized by various stakeholder groups.',
  'In addition to emissions requirements for the clean hydrogen PTC, language within the IRA has  led to discussions of additionality, deliverability, and time matching for existing and grid- connected facilities. Additionality dictates whether only newly constructed HESs can claim the  clean hydrogen PTC, or if existing hybrid facilities can retroactively add a hydrogen production  process to their facilities so that they can then claim the clean hydrogen PTC. As a result, there is  uncertainty as to whether additionality rules will reduce the number of facilities that will be  eligible for this incentive. Deliverability requires the direct use of local electricity resources  within the same region, as input to an electrolyzer. Both the electrolyzer and electricity  generation resources need to be located in the same defined regions, such as power market zones,  which will dictate electricity prices. The cost of electricity impacts the downstream price of  produced hydrogen, meaning that the location of an electrolyzer, and therefore its clean  hydrogen PTC eligibility, can be influenced by deliverability. Finally, time matching requires the  electrolyzer to match the output of real-time renewable generation. Hybrid power plants have an  advantage over single-technology VRE generation when considering time matching because of  their ability to provide more consistent power (Esposito, Gimon, and Oâ€™Boyle 2023).    3.5.3 Market Participation Constraints   Due to the novelty of hybrids, how these facilities are allowed to operate within energy markets  remains uncertain.',
  "Life-cycle GHG emissions reductions from various technologies compared with the  levelized subsidy value that they receive from IRA. The outlier is electrolysis, which receives a    higher subsidy relative to its GHG emissions reductions than other technologies, highlighting the  US government's focus on stimulating the hydrogen market (Cheng et al. 2023).    Markets signals frequently influence investment decision making. Researchers voiced concern  about the financing of these future investment decisions and how our grid will operate with sunk  investments. For future investments, Shobe was concerned with how to procure capital-intensive  technologies especially those on the earlier side of the development cycle such as bioenergy with         19    CCS. Looking at present day, power sector capital is expected to realign massively over the next  few years and there is a large amount of uncertainty with which technologies other than solar and  wind will be most prevalent. This leads to market uncertainty as well and uncertainty for  investors and companies about which technology to invest in. If this uncertainty causes them to  not invest in a clean technology after the retirement of an existing unit, it could delay reaching  net zero energy targets, leading to further exacerbating climate change (Van Der Zwaan 2023).  To reduce this delay, we need a new way to find promising, dependable investment opportunities  and avoid stranded assets.",

  'Furthermore, according to analysis conducted by NREL on the combined impacts of the BIL and  IRA, both together can increase clean electricity sharesâ€”which includes nuclear, fossil fuels  with CCUS, and renewablesâ€”up to 71%â€“90% of total generation by 2030, and can increase the  cumulative average annual combined deployment rate of wind and solar from 44 GW per year to  93 GW per year over the coming decade. The report concludes that both the BIL and IRA â€œâ€¦  have the collective potential to drive substantial growth in clean electricity by 2030,â€� (Steinberg  et al. 2023). The combined impact of the BIL and IRA show that policy can drive increased  renewable generation deployment that could also encourage hybridization.    2.1.2.6 State-Level Policy Support  Hybrid development has been broadly supported by state-level policies that incentivize the  adoption of VRE technologies with energy storage. Currently, state-specific policy addresses  residential- and commercial-scale projects. According to the National Conference of State  Legislators, â€œRenewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) require that a specified percentage of the  electricity utilities sell comes from renewable resourcesâ€� (2021). As a result of states requiring  electricity suppliers to provide a minimum percentage of electricity sales from renewable  resources to customers, the adoption of VRE resources has increased. Through statesâ€™ RPSs,  there are opportunities for continued policy development that explicitly address utility-scale  hybridsâ€”which often have larger nameplate capacities or are labeled â€œfront of the meterâ€�  facilitiesâ€”to further support deployment.',

  'These factors, over time, have driven the expansion  of single-technology VRE projects and electro-chemical storage, which has helped increased  hybrid deployment (Seel et al. 2022).     2.1.1 Decreasing Cost of Renewable Technologies  The growth of hybrids is underpinned by the broader deployment of renewable generation,  driven by cost declines in solar and wind energy. According to Lazard, the historical mean  unsubsidized levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of solar PV (-84%) and wind (-66%) have  decreased substantially from 2009, making them two of the most cost-competitive energy  sources on the market today (Bilicic and Scroggins 2023). As a result, VRE projects have proven  to be more economical than traditional power plants in many locations. According to the Annual  Energy Outlook 2022, it is anticipated that levelized costs of wind and solar will continue to  decrease until 2050 (EIA 2022).    The combined effects of decreasing costs of renewable technologies, and various energy and  emissions targets have influenced deployment trends in the United States. Renewable generation  has been steadily growing, as shown in Figure 1, and has reached 21.5% of the U.S. generation  share in 2022 (EIA 2021; Clark et al. 2022). Figure 1 shows the installed annual capacity from  2005 to 2021, illustrating that VRE sources such as solar and wind have increased their capacity  substantially, more than tripling installed capacity since 2005.',
  'The projected utilization rate, as defined by the EIA, is  â€œthe varying amount of electricity required over time and the existing resource mix in an area  where additional capacity is neededâ€� (EIA n.d.). Additionally, the related capacity value, as  defined by NREL, is â€œthe contribution of a power plant to reliably meeting demandâ€� (Madaeni,  Sioshansi, and Denholm 2012). Currently, determining the proper capacity value for an HPP is a  challenge because some stakeholders feel that an HPPâ€™s value is not accurately captured with  traditionally used capacity calculations. For example, the Electric Power Research Institute  claims that the addition of storage to solar or wind can materially change the capacity valuation.  However, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator claims that existing methods of  capacity evaluation are appropriate for hybrid resources in the near term. One alternative  mechanism that is currently being explored for estimating capacity values of an HPP is the  effective load carrying capability. This method determines the timing of when a resource can  generate electricity and when the grid is likely to need additional capacity. It can also represent  the entire project portfolio rather than individual resources (FERC 2021). However, the most  appropriate capacity evaluation method for HPPs is still undetermined (Awara et al. 2023).    Another way in which hybrids can increase their cost competitiveness is through potential  savings that are unlocked by sharing permitting and siting fees, as well as lower additional costs  associated with interconnections and upgrades (Klonari et al. 2019).',
  'Studies have shown that replacing power plants with low-cost  fuel inputs can allow for systemwide cost savings (Gagnon et al. 2022; Gagnon, Cowiestoll, and  Schwarz 2023). Therefore, lower wholesale electricity rates can be passed down to the ratepayer,  potentially saving consumers billions of dollars per year. Additionally, low-income households  can benefit the most from these cost savings because they often spend a larger share of their  income on electricityâ€”this is known as the householdsâ€™ â€œenergy burdenâ€� (EERE 2018).    Furthermore, the adoption of hybrids can enable the continued electrification of consumer and  commercial end uses. A large driver of this electrification is the replacement of natural gas with  electricity for space and water heating (White et al. 2021). NRELâ€™s ReStock tool has indicated  that continued electrification could increase required electricity generation capacity by 25% to  accommodate region-specific winter demand for electrified heating (White et al. 2021).    Additionally, hybrids can meet specific electricity needs for rural consumers. As previously  mentioned in Section 3.3.1, off-grid small-scale hybrid facilities can operate independently of the  grid, thus reducing a hybrid facilityâ€™s reliance on grid infrastructure.

  'In response, nations are exploring various transportation decarbonization  pathways. During IEW, speakers primarily focused on the effect of advanced transportation  technology on emissions globally, the implications of preferring electric vehicles (EVs) over  internal combustion engine vehicles on macroeconomic indicators and grid stability, and policy  analysis related to grid infrastructure and charging station coverage for EV users.         12    On a global scale, transportation decarbonization with advanced technologies and clean fuels  plays a critical role in global net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. From a technological perspective,  while biofuels and hydrogen play significant roles, particularly in the aviation and shipping  sectors, electrification remains a key element for decarbonizing transportation (Speizer 2023).  For example, in India, EV deployment has positive impact on GHG emissions, the total cost of  ownership and imports, while reducing government revenues and employment (Rajagopal 2023).    However, one of the main concerns about increasing EVs on the road is the potential strain on  the electrical grid. Smart charging technology such as V1G and V2G, which provide users with  flexibility in charging, has the potential to mitigate this risk by balancing the grid. V1G allows  control of charging time and magnitude of power demand based on grid status. In addition to  V1G smart charging property, V2G enables EVs to both charge from and discharge to the grid.',

  'However, now these resources can participate in the capacity, energy, and ancillary  service markets under the assumption that aggregated DERs are greater than the apportioned  value of individual DERs. Additionally, RTOs and ISOs have some flexibility in how the rules  are designed for DERs in specific markets, as long as double counting is prevented. One of the  major motivators for the creation of FERC Order 2222 was to improve wholesale power markets  to allow for a wider variety of price-responsive demand, which hybrids are capable of. A few  additional key motivators to the creation of FERC Order 2222 are the increase of variable  renewables leading to more power system flexibility and ancillary services, and the need for  power system reliability (Zhou, Hurlbut, and Xu 2021).

  'Additional uses of zero-carbon ammonia include  using it to replace bunker fuel, which can decarbonize ocean freight shipments, providing long- term energy storage in the electricity system, and offering a more cost-effective method for  transporting hydrogen (Global Maritime Forum 2020; The Royal Society 2020).    3.1.3 Green Desalination for Freshwater Production   HESs can also provide clean electricity for desalination processes to produce fresh water.  Desalination is an energy-intensive process that, according to DOE, â€œremoves salts and other  minerals from water to make it suitable for human consumption, irrigation, or industrial uses.â€�  The two most common desalination methods are thermal-based and membrane-based processes  (DOEâ€™s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [EERE] n.d.) Both techniques are  energy-intensive, and are traditionally supported by traditional generation technologies because  of their ability to provide firm power.9 Hybridization can replace traditional generation sources  by providing consistent electricity by pairing VRE technologies with complementary generation  profiles found with PV and wind, or by integrating with dispatchable energy storage  technologies. Therefore, hybrids can provide a decarbonization pathway for freshwater  production that has typically not been achieved by single-technology VRE sources or traditional  energy generation sources like coal, oil, and natural gas. Because of climate change, extreme  weather events like droughts are emphasizing the need for decarbonized freshwater production.',

  'Beyond  utility-scale HPPs, there is also increased development potential for behind-the-meter HPPs.  Both California and Hawaii have adopted policies to promote solar and storage behind-the-meter  HPPs, which sets the foundation for other states to replicate this type of policy framework, as  market conditions allow.     In addition to technological improvements and shifting market demands, further adoption of  HPPs is likely to be driven by the continuing declining costs of generation and storage  technologies. NRELâ€™s Annual Technology Baseline modeling indicates that utility-scale solar  PV could decline from an LCOE of $39.2/MWh in 2023 to $18.4/MWh by 2050 in the moderate  scenario. Similarly, the LCOE for land-based wind energy could decline from $29.7/MWh in  2023 to $18.8/MWh by 2050. The potential continued decreasing LCOE of solar and wind could  drive continued deployment of HPPs by increasing the economic competitiveness of renewable  technologies. Additionally, the deployment of HPPs is likely to be further accelerated by the  decline in the LCOE of PV plus storage, which is expected to decrease from $93.1/MWh in 2023  to $51.4/MWh in 2050 (-44.7%) (NREL 2023).',

  'Renewable diesel meets the same ASTM D975 fuel quality specification as petroleum diesel. It  is a drop-in fully fungible replacement for diesel and can be used in existing infrastructure and  engines. Consumption grew from 295 million gallons in 2013 to nearly 1.7 billion gallons in  2022 (EIA 2023c). For years, the market was served by two large U.S. plants in Louisiana and  imports. In the past 3 years, domestic production has grown significantly, largely driven by  petroleum companies converting existing refineries. As of January 2023, there are 17 plants with  3 billion gallons of capacity (EIA 2023f). More plants are expected in the near term.     Biodiesel production and consumption have been stable over the past decade, peaking in 2018  with slight declines from 2018 through 2022. In 2022, production and consumption were both  about 1.6 billion gallons (EIA 2023b). The number of plants has been declining since 2018, and  there are currently 59 plants with just over 2 billion gallons of capacity (EIA 2023g). Blends up  to B5 (5% biodiesel, 95% petroleum diesel) are considered diesel fuel per ASTM D975. B20  (6% to 20% biodiesel) that meets ASTM D7467 is approved for use in various vehicles and  engines. Biodiesel is also used for off-road applications such as home heating oil.',
  "This raises concern  about how markets will accurately compensate players for their participation. The discussion at  IEW ranged from VRE's effect on capacity markets (Holt 2023), ancillary service markets  (Hyungkwan Kim 2023) and wholesale markets (Ma 2023; Du 2023). Wind and solar  technologies are usually at the bottom of an electricity market dispatch stack and can help drive  electricity prices down due to their near zero marginal cost of generation. However, researchers  at IEW found that when wind output decreases due to a winter storm, it leads to an increase in  generation by gas units and therefore an increase in the spot price of liquefied natural gas. This  can sometimes cause generation from coal plants to become more economic than generation  from gas plants and can increase coal generation and the coal spot price. Therefore, while wind  and solar are not directly setting the electricity prices, their absence during extreme events can  contribute to an increase in electricity prices. With the participation of VREs expected to  continue to increase, it will be important to understand how to either mitigate or respond to these  oscillatory price signals.        Figure 8. Life-cycle GHG emissions reductions from various technologies compared with the  levelized subsidy value that they receive from IRA. The outlier is electrolysis, which receives a    higher subsidy relative to its GHG emissions reductions than other technologies, highlighting the  US government's focus on stimulating the hydrogen market (Cheng et al. 2023).",
  'The  following sections detail how hybrid power plants specifically, can provide energy reliability and  contribute to grid resiliency.    3.2.1 Energy Reliability   To maintain reliability, the grid operator must match demand for electricity with supply  generated at a specific frequency on a second-by-second basis. Historically, grid operators have  done this with traditional power sources that not only can provide baseload power consistently,  but ramp up and down quickly to meet variable demand needs. Baseload power is defined as â€œthe  minimum amount of electric power delivered or required over a given period at a steady rateâ€�  (EIA n.d.). Further, the ramp rate of a power source is defined as â€œthe speed at which a generator  can increase (ramp up) or decrease (ramp down) generationâ€� (EERE 2011). VRE technologies  present challenges in providing baseload power and electricity at peak demand times, due to their  dependence on fluctuating resource abundance. However, HPPs that include energy storage  technologies, as well as standalone storage facilities, can enable ancillary services by providing  load-shifting capabilities and maintaining system frequency, which ultimately helps compensate  for the challenges faced by single-technology VRE plants.    Electricity generation from VRE sources is often misaligned with electricity usage and is highly  dependent on the time and location of the renewable resources. Currently, during the times when  the electricity load cannot be supported by VRE sources, traditional energy sources must be used  to meet demand.',

  'The report titled Ad-Mat: Adaptations of Mature Manufacturing Strategies for Accelerated Redox Flow Battery Deployment can be summarized as follows: The concept of the Ad-Mat approach is to leverage existing adjacent markets across a broad scope of technologies in order to reduce the manufacturing learning curve and ultimately accelerate redox flow battery (RFB) deployment at scale. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the dominant energy storage technology, and they came to technological maturity under unique market conditions when there was no meaningful competition in the consumer electronic and electric vehicle (EV) space. Today, alternative chemistries that may be technologically better-suited for long-duration storage applications are experiencing a high barrier to entry. This is in large part due to the substantial bias towards the scaled-up production and supply chain that now exists for LIBs. In the case of RFBs in particular, numerous analyses have suggested that RFBs should theoretically have a much lower system cost than LIBs - however, this relies on a mature and competitive manufacturing landscape, which has been extremely challenging to achieve for both flow batteries and other LIB competitors. At the moment, LIB alternatives tend to have isolated small-scale manufacturing pathways, which preclude the economies of scale that would be required to compete with the mature LIB industry. In the present state of the industry, niche manufacturing tools and approaches have evolved to support each alternative technology, such that there is substantial replication and duplication in effort.',
  'In the present state of the industry, niche manufacturing tools and approaches have evolved to support each alternative technology, such that there is substantial replication and duplication in effort. Continuing to pursue a strategy of isolated manufacturing processes/approaches for each LIB-alternative may never allow for at-scale deployment. In order for RFBs to meaningfully compete with LIBs in the realm of LDES, a new disruptive approach based on cross-industry learning and coordination is needed - and this is exactly what our Ad-Mat concept aims to tackle. In this re-envisioned manufacturing landscape, tools and processes from mature industries can be adapted and deployed across the range of alternative energy storage technologies. Adapting tools, equipment, processes, and industrial learning from mature industries to meet the technological requirements of RFBs would open new markets for existing OEMs in adjacent industries, would prevent unnecessary duplication and re-development, would improve efficiency across the manufacturing chain, and would ultimately support reduced costs and accelerated deployment of RFBs at scale.',

  'In states without a reformulated gasoline  market, E15 typically cannot be sold in summer months due to a waiver needed for Reid vapor  pressure. However, an ongoing EPA emergency fuel waiver has allowed sales of E15 nationwide  year-round in 2022 and 2023 (EIA 2022). Nine midwestern states have approached EPA to  address the Reid vapor pressure issue (RFA 2023b).    2.7.1 Production, Consumption, and Capacity  The majority of ethanol is produced using dry-mill technology (92%); a small number of larger  plants use a wet-milling process (10%) (RFA 2023b). Dry milling is a process that grinds corn  grain into flour and ferments only the starch component into ethanol with coproducts of distillers  grains (an animal feed substitute) and carbon dioxide. Wet-mill plants primarily produce corn  grain sweeteners, along with ethanol and several other coproducts (such as corn oil and starch).     Figure 23 highlights 2022 ethanol production and consumption of more than 15 billion gallons  and nearly 14 billion gallons, respectively (EIA 2023a). Exports account for the difference in  production and consumption. Figure 24 shows cellulosic ethanol production, which has declined  in recent years. Since 2021, all cellulosic ethanol production is from bolt-on technology at  existing conventional ethanol plants, which extracts the corn fiber byproduct for processing into  ethanol. Adding cellulosic ethanol conversion technology to existing corn ethanol plants allows  these facilities to diversify their portfolios.',

  'Because several hydropower units have storage, they are  particularly useful for managing variability and uncertainty. Figure 24 provides an example of  the response from the Bradley Lake plant during the 4-day period shown in Figure 20. In this  example, the output of Bradley Lake (green) is shown along with the Railbelt-wide net load in  yellow. During the early morning of November 4, renewable generation exceeds demand,  resulting in very little net load to be met with hydropower or fossil generation. Bradley Lake  operates at its minimum output level during this period, and the plant operates at minimum  output about 40% of the time during the entire year in the 2040 Reference scenario. The rapid  reduction in wind and solar output on this day requires Bradley Lake to increase output to  maximum over this period, then continue to vary output in response to net load—driven by  renewable output across the entire Railbelt.

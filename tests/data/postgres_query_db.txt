Resilience is an essential consideration for energy \ntechnologies and projects (NREL 2022a). Resilience hubs are community-serving facilities that \nsupport residents before, during, and after disruptions (such as grid outages due to storms) and can \ngreatly enhance the ability of a community or region to withstand, respond to, and recover from \ndisruptive events, in addition to providing an array of additional benefits (Kramer, Belding, and Coney \n2023). Resilience hubs may be established in buildings that already serve the community, such as \nlibraries, schools, or community centers. Many communities are pursuing resilience hubs as a \nmeans of mitigating the growing impacts of climate change (Musalem and Hawthorne 2023). \n\n\nTo reduce greenhouse gas emissions, resilience hubs may be powered by clean energy technologies, \nincluding solar photovoltaics (PV) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). This report is intended \nto address design and deployment considerations for such resilience hubs. Resilience hub projects \nof this type comprise multiple technologies with a variety of potential use cases, benefits, and costs. \nThis multiplicity can lead to complex scenarios in which several \nparties form a coalition to design and/or install the many \nelements of a resilience hub.  \n\n\nTo provide clarity in this complex environment and ensure that \nthe built and installed project performs as desired, this report \noutlines key considerations for deploying solar PV and BESS in \na resilience hub context. The report will answer the following \nquestions: \n\n\n• What is the difference between blue-sky and black-sky conditions? What is required for \nresilience hubs to be successfully operated under both conditions? \n• What are the different services solar PV and BESS can provide under both blue-sky and \n\n\nblack-sky conditions?  \n• How do the goals of a resilience hub inform the selection and installation of solar PV and \n\n\nBESS technologies? \n• What is an operating envelope agreement (OEA), and how can it be used in the resilience \n\n\nhub context? \n\n\nThis report is ownership-agnostic and does not assume that any given system component is owned \nby a specific entity or organization; whether the various pieces of the system are owned by the same \nparty or different parties, it is important for resilience hub planners to clearly define the interactions \nof the technologies during both blue-sky and black-sky operation.  \n\n\nBlue-Sky Operations of Resilience Hubs \nWhile resilience hubs warrant significant attention on their performance during disasters and \noutages, blue-sky conditions prevail during the vast majority of the time (over 99.9%) in the United \nStates (Denholm 2024). As a result, the performance of a resilience hub’s solar PV and BESS in blue-\nsky conditions is crucial for delivering the planned value of the project. \n\n\nElectricity generated by solar PV is a key value proposition for many resilience hubs, routinely \nproviding energy cost savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. In blue-sky conditions, \nsolar energy can be used to supply power to the resilience hub host site’s facilities and equipment, \n\n\nBlue sky: normal, grid-connected \nconditions. \n\n\nBlack sky: conditions featuring \ndisruptive events (such as storms) \nand grid outages. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nThis report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. \n\n\nreducing demand for grid electricity (Aznar 2017). In some electric utility territories, excess solar \nelectricity production can be sent and sold back to the grid, further improving project economics \n(Zinamen et al. 2017). Comprehensive guides to solar installation can be found in the references \n(Fekete et al. 2023), but a high-level checklist of prerequisite conditions when deploying solar PV for \nuse in a resilience hub context includes: \n\n\n• The cost savings or revenue from the solar PV aligns with the host site’s economic \npriorities. \n\n\n• The built environment supporting the solar array, especially for roof-mounted PV panels, \nis structurally sound and not due for replacement. \n\n\n• The size and location of the solar array allows it to be successfully interconnected with \nthe local utility’s electric grid. \n\n\n• The PV system is procured and installed with components that can withstand storms and \ncontinue operating during emergencies and natural disasters (NREL 2022b).  \n\n\nA BESS can also provide cost savings or revenue during blue-sky conditions when the electric grid is \noperating without issue. The blue-sky function performed by a BESS is typically determined during \nthe project design phase so that the BESS specifications can be tailored to maximize the \neffectiveness of this function; common BESS use cases are described by Elgqvist (2021) and \ninclude:  \n\n\n• Behind-the-meter cost savings: A BESS can supply power to the resilience hub host site when \nelectricity prices are high. The BESS is then recharged from the grid when electricity prices \nare low. This price arbitrage reliably results in lower electric bills for the host site. \n\n\n• Front-of-the-meter grid services: A BESS can send power directly to the electric grid. This \narrangement can provide value to utilities by supplying electricity for broader consumption, or \nby managing electricity quality through ancillary services such as voltage or frequency \nregulation. Many utilities offer programs to compensate BESS owners for these services. \n\n\n• Demand management: Utilities may provide structured compensation to customers who can \nguarantee lower electricity consumption during times of peak demand on the grid (such as \nhot summer days). A BESS can support this demand management by providing a portion of \nthe host site’s electricity that would otherwise have to be supplied by the grid. \n\n\nFor both solar PV and battery technologies, it is important to consider the operational lifetime of the \nsystems. During said lifetime, routine maintenance is key to maximizing system performance and \nidentifying issues before the system is impacted. While operations and maintenance costs may be \nsmall relative to the cost of the system (NREL 2023), maintenance services should be performed by \nan experienced and skilled provider, and those services should be agreed upon before the system is \ninstalled. Once a technology reaches the end of its useful life, having a plan for decommissioning the \nsystem can ensure that its environmental impacts are minimized in alignment with the goals of the \nsystem owner. If the system owner knows how they want the technology to be handled at the time of \ndecommissioning, those instructions can be included in the system procurement phase. The markets \nfor technology recycling and used/second-life batteries are also active areas of research and growth, \nso new opportunities and structures for system decommissioning may emerge during the system’s \nlifetime (NREL n.d.). \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 \n\n\nThis report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. \n\n\nBlack-Sky Operations of Resilience Hubs \nResilience hubs must be able to operate reliably during a grid outage. Achieving this operational \ncertainty can be complicated by the number of technologies and owners involved in the resilience \nhub project, who may have separate goals. In all cases, the component technologies of the system \nmust be able to support the desired operations. For both solar PV and battery storage, the project \ndesign should be clear regarding how and where power is delivered during both blue-sky and black-\nsky operations. \n\n\nBecause most solar arrays do not have moving parts, little changes for the solar PV system itself \nwhen transitioning to black-sky operation. It can still produce electricity; the only difference is that \nthe solar electricity is used for resilient power (black-sky operation) instead of providing cost savings \nor revenue (blue-sky operation). However, for the solar power to be effectively used during an outage, \nthe host site must be able to electrically isolate, or “island,” itself in accordance with utility \nrequirements such that utility staff working to repair the outage are not put in danger due to the \nresilience hub’s active power (Belding, Walker, and Watson 2020). The same islanding requirements \napply to battery systems’ ability to provide power during an outage. To achieve this autonomy, the \nresilience hub project typically must include specialized electrical islanding equipment, microgrid \ncontrols, and other site-specific electric configuration costs.  \n\n\nBeyond the system’s ability to perform, a trade-off often encountered by resilience hub planners is \nthe degree to which solar PV and BESS should be optimized for blue-sky economic performance \nversus resilience performance. Technology specifications and operational parameters may vary \ndepending on whether a system is designed to meet certain resilience benchmarks or maximize \neconomic gains, as evinced by the following examples: \n\n\n• Technology specifications example: A BESS that provides front-of-the-meter grid services \nmust discharge power for short periods of time to serve its function of maintaining grid \nstability. A battery optimized for front-of-the-meter grid service provision may be at odds with \na resilience goal of surviving a 10-day power outage, which would instead require the BESS \nto supply its power over a longer duration. Selecting for blue-sky performance would increase \nthe revenue generated by the system but could potentially result in less robust resilience \nperformance, and vice versa.  \n\n\n• Operational parameters example: A BESS used for behind-the-meter cost savings can \nmaximize those savings by fully discharging its energy during economically favorable \nconditions (e.g., high electricity prices or peak demand). Maximizing revenue in this way \nwould shorten the payback period for the BESS. However, doing so would increase the risk \nthat a grid outage coincides with the BESS being nearly empty of charge. If an outage were to \noccur while the BESS has a low state of charge, the capability of the resilience hub to provide \npower would be diminished. Setting a minimum allowable state of charge in the design and \nprocurement stages of deployment can provide a baseline of certainty from which resilient \noperations can be planned. \n\n\nFor a resilience hub to achieve its ideal combination of blue-sky and black-sky performance, project \nplanners and multi-stakeholder project development teams should be clear and aligned on the \nsystem’s goals and priorities. For cases in which those goals and priorities are in competition, or are \nsources of disagreement among project coalition members, contractual mechanisms such as OEAs \ncan provide clarity and certainty on resilience hub design and operation. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 \n\n\nThis report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. \n\n\nOperating Envelope Agreements and Resilience Hub \nPlanning \nAn OEA is an emerging contractual concept between the parties involved in the development of the \nresilience hub site and the utility that serves it. The objective of an OEA is to identify a mutually \nagreeable set of technical operating requirements for a PV and storage system (including hours of \nenforcement, called an “operating envelope”). The operating requirements limit risk to neighboring \ncustomers and the utility’s electric infrastructure. In addition, an OEA can provide certainty to both \nthe utility and resilience hub system owner (Gill et al. 2022). From the perspective of the system \nowner, this contractual agreement can unlock revenue while preserving the system owner’s control \nover the paired PV and energy storage system and providing certainty required for project financing.  \n\n\nAn OEA can be a useful formalization of responsibilities and operating conditions for resilience hub \nsolar PV + BESS projects in which there are multiple owners of system components or ambiguous \nutility policies that govern the project’s operation. Scenarios in which establishing an OEA for a \nresilience hub may be useful include (but are not limited to): \n\n\n• When an entity other than the resilience hub host site owns and operates the BESS during \nblue-sky conditions, an OEA could contractually stipulate that a certain amount of the battery \nsystem’s state of charge be maintained at all times to ensure a minimum threshold of \nresilient operation in an outage. \n\n\n• On electrical distribution grids with constrained hosting capacity, an OEA can help solar PV + \nBESS projects achieve a greater allowable system size than solar PV alone. This is \naccomplished by setting parameters for when the PV output to the grid will be controlled by \nthe BESS. \n\n\n• If multiple parties are responsible for installing the solar PV and BESS, an OEA template \ncould be adapted to guarantee that those systems are installed in such a way that the solar \nPV is able to recharge the BESS during black-sky conditions, even if the solar PV is not \ndesigned to recharge the BESS during blue-sky operation. \n\n\n \n\n\nKey Takeaways \nBased on the points covered in this report, planners of resilience hubs featuring solar PV and BESS \ntechnologies should make sure to define the following features of their project: \n\n\n• Blue-sky cost savings or revenue generation: the value propositions and use cases for solar \nPV and BESS at the host site during blue-sky conditions \n\n\n• Black-sky resilience services and performance: the goals and functions of the resilient energy \nsystem, including the identification of electrical loads to be supported during an outage \n\n\n• Islanding and utility compliance: the sufficiency of the system’s electrical equipment and \ninterconnection agreement to enable power supply during a grid outage \n\n\n• System operations and maintenance: ensuring that a capable and experienced entity is \ntasked with operations and maintenance duties, as host site staff may not have the required \nexpertise \n\n\n• System decommissioning: a plan for technology sale, reuse, or disposal when the systems \nhave reached the end of their useful lives (NREL n.d.). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nThis report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. \n\n\nReferences \n\n\nAznar, Alexandra. 2017. “Back to Basics: Unraveling How Distributed Generation is Compensated \nand Why It's Important.” NREL.

The report titled Achieving Scale: Community Solar Technical Potential and Meaningful Benefits in the United States can be summarized as follows: The slide deck was presented at the webinar on February 28th titled Achieving Scale: Community Technical Potential and Meaningful Benefits in the United States. It describes the National Community Solar Partnership program followed by methodology and results from a study on the technical potential of community solar and associated meaningful benefits. A key finding of the study suggests that the opportunity space for community solar to meet unmet demand for solar energy is not primarily constrained by technical potential, but by technological, market, and policy factors. NREL used rooftop and ground-mount photovoltaic siting data to model annual energy production from community solar based on various constraints and system performance. Given modeled results and community solar deployment, we discuss potential benefits including household savings, low-to-moderate income household access to solar, resilience and grid benefits, community ownership, workforce development and entrepreneurship as well as insights into community solar siting opportunities.

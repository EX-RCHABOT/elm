The following is brief biography for Aliza Abraham who is a Postdoctoral Researcher-Mechanical Engineering at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory:
Aliza Abraham is interested in understanding the complex interactions between atmospheric flow and wind turbines. Her research particularly focuses on characterizing the turbine wake in order to mitigate its detrimental effects on downstream turbines. She has experience conducting laboratory experiments, field measurements, and numerical simulations. At NREL, Aliza is working on analyzing data coming out of the American WAKE experimeNt (AWAKEN) field campaign.Â 

Aliza Abraham's Research Interests includes the following:
Wind turbine wake behavior
Atmospheric flow characterization
Field data analysis

Web Scraping and information Extraction
***************************************

In this example, we demonstrate how to set up your own end-to-end web scraping and information extraction pipeline.
Specifically, we set up a procedure to extract the name of NREL's current director using only Wikipedia articles.
You can dive right into the `end-to-end example code <web_scraping_pipeline.py>`_ (under 200 lines!) or head over
to the `tutorial <example_scrape_wiki.ipynb>`_ for more in-depth details.
